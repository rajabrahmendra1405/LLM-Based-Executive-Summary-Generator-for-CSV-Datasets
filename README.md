# Data Analyzer with LLM Agents

**Data Analyzer with LLM Agents** is an intelligent application designed to analyze CSV files using advanced language models. The app leverages LangChain agents in the background to enable seamless analysis and provides the flexibility to choose from a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini, Claude, or GPT. With this tool, you can generate descriptive statistics for any uploaded dataset, visualize columns, and even ask questions about your dataâ€”getting answers powered by LLMs.

## Features

- **LLM Selection:** Choose from models like Gemini, Claude, or GPT to power your data analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Automatically generate descriptive statistics as soon as the dataset is uploaded.
- **Column Visualization:** Plot any selected column and get insights from the LLM based on the generated graph.
- **Ask Questions:** Ask any question about your dataset, and receive insightful answers from the selected LLM.
